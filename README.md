# Beyond Human Detection: Advanced AI-based Intrusion Detection Model for Detecting Insider Threats in Cybersecurity

## Description

Code for detecting insider threats using a deep learning model applied to tabular data. Deep feature synthesis is employed to construct detailed tabular user profiles based on event data. Then, a binary deep learning model is developed to achieve three objectives: (i) identification of malicious users through supervised learning, (ii) evaluation of how well generative algorithms can mimic real user profiles, and (iii) differentiation between real and synthetic abnormal activities.
